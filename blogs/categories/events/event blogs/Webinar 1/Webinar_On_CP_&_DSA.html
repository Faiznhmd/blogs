        <h2>INTRODUCTION:</h2><br>
        <p>Bill Gates once said, "software is a great combination between artistry and engineering". In this digital,data-driven world, where countless new softwares are being implemented at every technical industry,programming is becoming all the more sought after.</p><br>

        <p> Many technocrats wish to be placed as a Software Engineer in highly reputed companies. Many of us have been suggested to dive into programming by parents, peers and Placement Cell , yet some fellow students lack knowledge about where to start the programming journey. IETE Students' Forum found out about these common queries and formulated a webinar provide guidance on how to set out towards one's coding journey and also on how to improve their practices. The webinar was held on 28th June 2022 , LIVE on YouTube 6.P.M. onwards.
        </p><br>


        <h2>
            THE GUEST SPEAKER:
        </h2><br>
        <p>
            Mr. Shyam Kumar Singh ( BIT Sindri, Computer Science Department, Batch-2k18) was the best man for the job.
            He is , at the time of writing this blog, a 5 star Coder in Code - Chef, a Software Engineer at Cisco and is placed in Amazon as a Software Development Engineer. His helpfulness , humble nature likeable personality enabled him to connect positively with the viewers. His immense knowledge and hands-on experience were of great help to the viewers. He made the webinar interesting all the way through and us get acquainted with Competitive Programming.
        </p><br>
        <p>
            The anchors for the webinar, Ms. Vaidehi Singh from Batch 2k20 and Mr. Adarsh Trivedi from Batch 2k21, introduced the viewers to the guest speaker and begun with asking him the most sought- after questions.
        </p><br>

        <h2>
            THE ROADMAP TO COMPETITIVE PROGRAMMING:
        </h2><br>
        <p>
            The first step towards Competitive programming is learning a programming language. Shyam sir suggested starting with either C++ or Java. He added that the choice of programming language does not matter strictly in the long run.
        </p><br>
        <p>
            Consistency is Key. Once you learn a programming language, you should start solving questions on various coding platforms.
        </p><br>
        <p>
            Top Coder, Code chef, Codeforces , Leetcode are a few examples of such platforms. One should consistently keep taking part in coding challenges and contests , gradually increasing in difficulty over time.
        </p><br>
        <p>
            In order to improve, one should keep learning new concepts and improve their already established Mathematics concepts.
        </p><br>

        <h2>
            IMPORTANCE OF D.S.A.:
        </h2><br>
        <p>
            Knowledge of Data Structures and Algorithms is necessary for complex coding problems. One should grasp concepts of D.S.A well to fare well In Competitive Programming.
        </p><br>

        <h2>
            DEVELOPMENT OR C.P. ?
        </h2><br>
        <p>
            Shyam sir beautifully cleared the most common doubt that always lingers in computer science enthusiasts. He said the choice is never between Development or C.P. It is always both Development and C.P. that have great importance. After learning coding languages, one should maintain a healthy balance between practicing Competitive programming and Development.
        </p><br>

        <h2>
            CHECK YOUR PROGRESS:
        </h2><br>
        <p>
            When learning Competitive Programming, one should go through the code of the top coders of each contest and analyse them properly. Take guidance from seniors. Whenever you are in the need for help with any code or are not sure how to progress further, you should approach your seniors. They will also help to keep your motivated and check your progress.
        </p><br>

        <h2>
            BUILD YOUR ONLINE PRESENCE :
        </h2><br>
        <p>
            Online C.P. profiles do matter to crack interviews. Keep building a strong coding profile by giving frequent contests. Shyam sir suggested to have good connections in LinkedIn as internship opportunities and job vacancies are posted on it regularly. Off- campus internships is the way forward to crack your dream tech-company. One should also lookout for research internship opportunities and avail then to the fullest.
        </p><br>

        <h2>
            CONCLUSION:
        </h2><br>
        <p>
            To summarise, Shyam sir explained the importance of D.S.A for Competitive Programming, he shared the roadmap to C.P. and explained the role of research internships. He also cleared the common queries like - what to choose from between Development and C.P. , how to keep checking your progress and many other questions which were dropped by the viewers in the comments section.
        </p><br>
        <p>
            Mr. Shyam Kumar Singh sir was presented a token of love by Team IETE. The anchors expressed their gratitude, on behalf of the viewers, to the guest speaker for taking out time from his busy schedule and providing the viewers with invaluable guidance.
        </p><br>
        <p>
            The Webinar concluded with an exciting Menti-Quiz on C- Programming. The winners were indentified and awarded exciting prizes.
