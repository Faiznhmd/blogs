            "Software is like entropy. It is difficult to grasp, weighs nothing, and obeys the second law of thermodynamics; i.e. it always increases" - Norman R. Augustine
        </p><br>

        <p>
            IETE Students' Forum in association with @codingblocks conducted an exhilarating webinar under the guidance of the Career Development Center, BIT Sindri, on one of the most sought-after topics" How to crack product-based companies?" to ignite students' passion for coding.
        </p><br>

        <h2>
            INTRODUCTION 
        </h2><br>

        <p>
            Mr. Monu Kumar, an expert at Coding Blocks took up the role to introduce the participants to the detailed roadmap to a career in software engineering. 
        </p><br>

        <h2>
            CAN NON-CS AND IT STUDENTS GET PLACED IN IT COMPANIES
        </h2><br>

        <p>
            The first question that arises in every non-CS and IT branch students is that can they get a job in IT companies if they have relevant skill-set. The guest speaker stated that branch didn't matter if we had relevant skill-set.
        </p><br>

        <h2>
            THE THREE CATEGORIES OF COMPANIES THAT COME FOR PLACEMENTS 
        </h2><br>

        <p>
            There are three categories of companies that come for placement,  namely Service-Based,  Product-Based and Startups. Service-Based companies require intermediate level of coding skills. Startups require greater level of coding skills and they also require equivalent level of development skills. Product-Based companies demand the highest level of coding skills and development skills is not a necessary requirement. 
        </p><br>

        <h2>
            COMPETITIVE PROGRAMMING AND DEVELOPMENT
        </h2> <br>
        <p>
            Competitive programming is a long term journey. Participants were advised to give 3-4 hours to competitive programming and devote some time to learn the basics of development as it will give them an upper hand over others who have similar coding skills bit lack development skills. 
        </p><br>

        <h2>
            INTERVIEW PREP
        </h2><br>

        <p>
            If someone is not able to do or does not wish to do competitive programming and wants to get placed in product-based companies then they should opt for interview prep. The speaker strongly advised participants to practice minimum 400-500 questions on LeetCode and participate in weekly challenges.
        </p><br>

        <h2>
            ROADMAP TO PRODUCT BASED COMPANIES
        </h2> <br>
        <p>
            Mr.  Monu Kumar detailed about the roadmap to product based companies. He laid stress on problem solving skills. The first and foremost skill required to get placed in product-based company is problem solving skill.  To improve problem solving skills one must practice a lot of Data Structure and Algorithm  questions. He asked third and final year students to start DSA as soon as possible and told first and second year students that they would be in a strong position if they started DSA then. He recommended to learn C++ or Java for competitive programming so that they learn the concept of OOP, he asked them to dodge Python as its library makes the work easy and doesn't build logical skills. Monu Sir cautioned participants against learning DSA and competitive programming simultaneously and advised to start to DSA and then moving on to competitive programming. 
        </p><br>

        <h2>
            OTHER REQUIREMENTS 
        </h2><br>

        <p>
            Apart from strong DSA and and little knowledge of development, the participants should also focus on System Design. A major chunk of low level design is covered in DSA and basic project-related high level design is sufficient. The speaker suggested to study non-coding subjects like OS, DBMS, SQL and computer networking.
        </p><br>

        <h2>
            MENTI QUIZ 
        </h2><br>
        
        <p>
            The interactive session was followed by a nimble-witted quiz. The questions covered topics of Data Structure and Algorithm. The participants had a tug-of-war for the top 3 spots. 
        </p><br>

        <h2>
            EVENT LAUNCH
        </h2><br>

        <p>
            Last but not the least, the webinar unveiled Encipher, a 14 days long Competitive Programming event.
        </p><br>

        <h2>
            CONCLUSION
        </h2> <br>

        <p>
            It was a constructive webinar for those who want to set a foot towards their dream job in the software industry. It motivated participants to work hard in right direction to achieve their dream job.
