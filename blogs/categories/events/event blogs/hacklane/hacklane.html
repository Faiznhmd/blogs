        <p>After the successful conduction of the 1st webinar of our webinar series we were very excited to
            move forward and announce the second webinar on the topic <b>Security Intelligence.</b> And the
            guest speaker for this session is Dinesh Paranthagan.</p><br>
        <p><b>Dinesh Paranthagan</b> is the CEO & Founder of <b>Hackup Technology, Coimbatore.</b> He has an
            experience for about 8 years in managing and administrating in the domain of Cyber security

            around Tamil Nadu. It also offers the Information Security /services, VAPT, Risk Audit and Public
            compliance solution to it's customers and clients.
            And he taught us what actually security intelligence is and what are its benifits like:
            The term Security Intelligence describes the practice of collecting, standardizing and analyzing
            data that is generated by networks, applications, and other IT infrastructure in real-time, and the
            use of that information to assess and improve an organization's security posture.
            It Supported the consumption of threat intelligence, it's divided into four differing types. they're
            specifically strategic threat intelligence , tactical threat intelligence , operational threat
            intelligence , and technical threat intelligence</p><br>
        <p>Security Intelligence aids both regulatory and internal policy compliance by logging and
            proactively monitoring diverse information across the enterprise in real time, providing
            accountability, transparency and measurability.</p><br>
        <p>After the successful session there was an interesting quiz in which a good amount of
            parricipants participated and also praised the way we condudted the session and the quiz.</p><br><br>

        <p>After the blooming conduction of the 1st & 2nd webinar, we were now very thrilled to move
            forward to intend to make people more cognizant of security via our third webinar on the topic
            <b>SQL Injection</b>, and the guest speaker for this session is<b> Riyaz Rafi Ahmed.</b></p><br>
        <p>Mr. Riyaz Rafi Ahmed is a highly motivated and self-driven Cybersecurity Professional & Public
            Speaker with more than 3 years of experience in Architecting Defensive Solutions, DevSecOps,
            and Managing Information Security at <b>Hippo Video</b>. He is also active in the Cybersecurity
            community as a speaker and has been invited to multiple talks related to Online Privacy,
            Personal security, and has conducted Security awareness training for a wide range of audiences
            from students to seasoned industry professionals.
            Cybersecurity is a subject that requires logic, knowledge, thought, and commitment. It can be
            applied or research-based. It is a true leveler for all to enter, be successful, and lead the future
            of Cyber Security.</p><br>
        <p>He taught us that SQL is a common attack vector that uses malicious SQL code for backend
            database manipulation to access information that was not intended to be displayed. This
            information may include any number of items, including sensitive company data, user lists, or
            private customer details. And many more things about SQL.</p><br>
        <p>After completing this exciting session we moved forward to the quiz session where many
            participants engaged and reviewed it.</p><br><br>
        <h3><b>CONCLUSION</b></h3><br>
        <p>The webinar <b>'HACKLANE'</b> ended with a massive ascendancy. It was a three-day webinar series
            in which we had three guest speakers with their respective topics on ethical hacking. All the
            sessions were highly enlightening for the attendees and the viewers. The workshop aimed to
            make this an eminent opportunity to grab knowledge and prosper skills in ethical hacking. It
            focused on <b>Security intelligence, SQL injection, and how to make a career in all this.</b> In the end,
