        <h3><b>Introduction</b></h3><br>

        <p><b>Cryptocurrency</b> is a form of digital currency that involves a mechanism for issuing and transferring money. This money is usually generated outside of the issuing government but can be created within that jurisdiction. The major difference between a typical currency and a Cryptocurrency is the fact that it does not have an in-built checkbook mechanism. Some popular cryptocurrencies are <b>Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin, Litecoin,</b> and many more. Different forms of cryptocurrencies also use different techniques for the issuance and transfer of their tokens. For instance, the most famous form of Cryptocurrency, namely Ethereum, works in the form of a <b>blockchain.</b></p><br>
        
        <h3><b>Blockchain Technology and how Crypto works using this technology</b></h3><br>
        
        <p>Business runs on information. The briskly it's entered and the more accurate it is, the better. Blockchain is ideal for delivering that information because it provides immediate, participating, and fully transparent information stored on an inflexible tally that can be penetrated only by permitted network members. A blockchain network can track orders, payments, accounts, products, and much further. And because members partake in a single view of the variety, you can see all details of a sale end to end, giving you lesser confidence, as well as new edges and openings.</p><br>
        
        <h3><b>Crucial rudiments of a blockchain </b></h3><br>
        
        <h4>Distributed tally technology</h4><br>
        
        <p>All network actors have access to the distributed tally and its inflexible record of deals. With this participating tally, deals are recorded only formally, barring the duplication of trouble that's typical of traditional business networks.</p><br>
        
        <h4>Inflexible records</h4><br>
        
        <p>No party can change or tamper with a sale after it's been recorded to the participating ledger. However, a new sale must be added to reverse the error, and both deals are also visible, If a sale record includes an error. </p><br>
        
        <h4>Smart contracts </h4><br>
        
        <p>To speed deals, a set of rules — called a <b>smart contract</b> — is stored on the blockchain and executed automatically. A smart contract can define conditions for commercial bond transfers, including terms for trip insurance to be paid and much further. </p><br>
        
        <p>The Bitcoin protocol is erected on a blockchain. In an exploration paper introducing the digital currency, Bitcoin's pseudonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, described it as “ a new electronic cash system that's completely blink-to-peer, with no trusted third party.”<br>The crucial thing to understand then is that Bitcoin simply uses blockchain as a means to transparently record a tally of payments, but blockchain can, in a proposition, be used to immutably record any number of data points. As bandied over, this could be in the form of deals, votes in an election, product supplies, state identifications, deeds to homes, and much further.</p><br>
        
        <h3><b>BitCoin Mining</b></h3><br>
        
        <p>Pioneered in 2009, the digital world of crypto assets has turned up as an economic gorilla. Bitcoin trading has become a secure investment for many.</p><br>
        
        <p>Bitcoin mining, as the name suggests, is the issuance of cryptocurrency by solving complex mathematical calculations using highly powerful machines. "Mining" is done using complex hardware that solves a very complex mathematical problem. Methods such as CPU mines, GPU mines, FPGA mines, ASIC mines independently or as part of cloud mining are mainly used to mine bitcoin.</p><br>
        
        <p>Cryptocurrency mines are complex, expensive, and sometimes rewarding. However, attractive mines do not attract more investors who are interested in cryptocurrency because miners are rewarded for their work with crypto tokens. This may be because business types see the mines as cents from heaven, like the California gold miners of 1849.</p><br>
        
        <p>Mining has increased significantly in India over the past few years, with companies such as Easyfi Network providing mining services and blockchain development in the country. Mining in India is comparatively expensive and less profitable. This is because currency exchanges are very high, and efficient computing is now required to successfully mine coins.</p><br>
        
        <h3><b>Benefits of Crypto</b></h3><br>
        
        <h4>SECURE AND PRIVATE</h4><br>
        
        <p>Privacy and security are major concerns for cryptocurrency. A blockchain ledger is based on puzzles that are hard to decode. This makes a cryptocurrency more secure than ordinary transactions.</p><br>
        
        <h4>DECENTRALIZED</h4><br>
        
        <p>Cryptocurrencies are mainly decentralized. A lot of cryptocurrencies are controlled by the developers using it and the people who have a significant amount of coin, or by an organization to develop it before it is released into the market. Decentralization helps to keep the currency monopoly free and in check so that no organization can determine the flow.</p><br>
        
        <h4>COST-EFFECTIVE MODE OF TRANSACTION</h4><br>
        
        <p>Cryptocurrencies are mainly used to send money across borders. With the help of cryptocurrency, the transaction fee paid by a user is reduced to negligible or zero amount. It does by eliminating the need for third parties, like Visa or PayPal.</p><br>
        
        <h4>SELF-GOVERNED AND MANAGED</h4><br>
        
        <p>Governance and maintenance of any currency is a major factor for development. The cryptocurrency transactions are stored by developers on their hardware, and they get the transaction fee as a reward for doing so.</p><br>
        
        <h4>PROTECTION FROM INFlATION</h4><br>
        
        <p>A major cause of the decline of many currencies is <b>inflation.</b> Therefore every cryptocurrency is launched with a fixed amount at the time of release. So, as the demand increases, its value increases which will keep up with the market in the long run, preventing inflation.</p><br>
        
        <h3><b>Concerns regarding Cryptocurrency</b></h3><br>
        
        <h4>Security risk</h4><br>
        
        <p>By aiming to hack a cryptocurrency exchange, hackers can gain exposure to thousands of accounts and digital wallets where the cryptocurrencies are stored.</p><br>
        
        <h4>Issue of inheritance</h4><br>
        
        <p>The unregulated nature of Bitcoin means that without the key needed to view our relative's digital wallet, there is no way of expressing their funds if they are to pass away.</p><br>
        
        <h4>Market risk</h4><br>
        
        <p>Within their short time, they have seen vicious swings in value and major sensitivity to headlines due to the high number of informal and amateur investors. If there is continued resistance to the adoption of Bitcoins in other cryptocurrencies, they may lose value.</p><br>
        
        <h4>Environmental concern</h4><br>
        
        <p>Recently, one of the most famous crypto, i.e. Bitcoin was in trend because of the environmental harm involved in its mining. One of the world's richest persons and CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, Elon Musk made a tweet on discontinuing trade made in Bitcoin for the very reason which resulted in a heavy decline in its value. The transaction made in bitcoin is monitored by a network of miners around the world who simultaneously solve complex equations using specific software and plenty of energy. Though, there are other Cryptocurrencies that are more environmentally friendly and can be seen as a better alternative.</p><br>
        
        <p>Apart from these three major issues, there is also a concern regarding <b>Valuation difficulties, regulatory and legal dilemmas, data and modeling obstacles, illiquidity and trading cost, custody, clearing, and settlement problems.</b></p><br>
        
        <h3><b>What future holds for Crypto</b></h3><br>
        
        <p>In the present day, crypto is not just another form of currency but has created a whole investment market of its own. The corona pandemic proved to be a boon for this market and resulted in a huge inflow of investments and transactions into it. But this market is in its infant stage and the world and systems are still trying to figure out what to do with this new technological dystopia.</p><br>
        
        <p>The future regulations taken by the governments of different countries will play a huge role in determining the faith of Crypto. Very recently, the government of India had announced to bring in the regulation bill on cryptocurrency in the winter session. Though the bill has been further delayed, sources suggested that the bill was going to ban all private cryptocurrencies, leaving a few big players. Also, the bill had an aim to create an official digital currency issued by the RBI. Although, a year ago, the Indian government was planning to introduce a bill to ban all crypto transactions throughout the country. Though that bill was soon scrapped and a new committee was established to study and discuss the matter.</p><br>
        
        <p>This situation tells us about the confusion in the institutions regarding cryptocurrencies. Apart from this, the trust in crypto transactions and their adoption by broader institutes like digital transaction gateways will too play a big part in crypto's future.</p><br>
        
        <p>But from an investment perspective, no one can predict what the future holds for the market. It's new and very speculative without much backing of history on which one can base predictions. No matter how many predictions one makes, no one knows. So, invest in the crypto market only if you are prepared to lose. If your plans are for long-term wealth building, then it's better to stick to more conventional forms of investments.</p><br>
        
        <h3><b>Conclusion</b></h3><br>
        
        <p>For the world of the 21st century, cryptocurrency might prove to be the next biggest revolution after the Internet. The Internet connected the whole world, democratized the process of information sharing, and paved the way towards enhanced globalization. Crypto has become a global currency. Because of its decentralized nature, it has broken the shackles of currency inequalities and has again put the whole human race on a single trading system, free of any external control. In prehistoric times, an early human from India needed not to worry if his banana would lose its value in China, Europe, or America. It will be happening after a long time in the history of human trading that two humans can trade with each other without any institutional interference.</p><br>
