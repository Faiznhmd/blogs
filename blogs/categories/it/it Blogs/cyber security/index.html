        <h2>INTRODUCTION:</h2><br>
        <p>In modern days, the prevalence of corporate cybersecurity breaches, phishing scams, internet fraud, and similar alarming incidents is overwhelming. Cybercrime has emerged as a substantial problem, underscoring the critical need for robust cybersecurity practices.
Data security is essential in all sectors, be it businesses, government entities, organizations, or individuals, the priority is to ensure the security of information. Considering the extensive part of our lives that relies on virtual platforms—encompassing personal data, financial transactions, and daily professional activities—establishing security measures is paramount.

        <h2>Who is a Cyber Security Architect?
</h2><br>
        <p>A cybersecurity architect, also known as a "security architect," holds the responsibility of conceptualizing, developing, and upholding security systems within an organization's IT network, encompassing computer systems and data.
This professional assesses the security infrastructure of the organization for potential vulnerabilities. They conduct penetration tests, risk assessments, and ethical hacking across LANs, WANs, and VPNs. Additionally, they evaluate the performance and effectiveness of routers, firewalls, and similar systems.
Essentially, they are the pivotal figures, the ones at the helm in the realm of cybersecurity.

        <h2>How Do You Become a Cyber Security Architect?
</h2><br>
       <br>
<p>
    
A degree, either a Bachelor's or Master's, in cybersecurity, computer science, information technology, or a related field is typically required. If lacking this educational background, taking specific IT-focused classes might suffice.
In terms of practical experience, most businesses seek candidates with five to ten years of workplace IT experience. This experience should cover systems analysis, application development, and business planning, with a specific focus of three to five years on security matters.
Success in cybersecurity architecture necessitates a distinct skill set. In terms of "soft" skills, the ideal candidate excels in communication, leadership, and problem-solving. A cybersecurity architect must effectively manage projects, lead teams, and communicate complex technical concepts to non-technical personnel within the organization.

</p>
    <br>
        <p>
            
A competent cybersecurity architect should possess a variety of the following hard skills:

        <ul>
            <li>	Proficiency in Windows, UNIX, and Linux systems.

</li>
            <li>	Familiarity with ISO 27001/27002, ITIL, and COBIT frameworks.

</li>
            <li>	Understanding of perimeter security controls like firewalls, IDS/IPS, network access controls, and network segmentation.

</li>
            <li>Development and definition of network security architecture.

</li>
            <li>Experience in various aspects of wireless security, including routers, switches, and VLAN security.

            </li>
            <li>
	Knowledge of security concepts related to DNS, encompassing routing, authentication, VPN, proxy services, and DDOS mitigation technology.
</li>
<li>	Comprehension of third-party auditing and cloud risk assessment methodology.</li>
         
        </ul>
        </p><br>
